  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <p><b>Does every food parcel come with a free mask for the person collecting and a free hand sanitizer bottle?</b><p>
  <p>Yes, that is correct. To help our users in the fight against Covid-19 we are providing a free mask with every food parcel given out along with a free hand sanitizer bottle.</p>
  <p><b>What's going on in food banks right now? <br>i.e. Are they running out of donations, are they shutting down?</b> </p>
  <p>Wherever possible, food bank volunteers and staff will continue to provide support to people in crisis in their local communities.
    <br>
    As the coronavirus pandemic unfolds in the UK, our main priority is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it's someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation. It's hard for us to say exactly what will happen in the coming weeks across the UK – we don't know precisely how the outbreak will develop, and each food bank in our network is a local charity, run by a community for a community, and each will be affected differently.
    <br>
    We haven't yet heard that any food bank in our network is running out of all food donations, but food banks are running low on certain items so we really encourage you to support your local food bank if you're able to. Some might also be changing their opening hours or the way they operate due to the outbreak. You can find your local food bank using our map www.TheCamdenPoint.com/find-a-foodbank and visit their website to see what's happening in your area.</p>
  <p><b>What do food banks need?</b></p>
  <p>The food banks in our network rely on donations from their local communities. We're expecting to see more people needing to use food banks over the coming weeks as a result of the pandemic and if you're able to support your local food bank either by donating food, offering financial support, or volunteering we would really encourage you to get involved.
    You can find out more about what items are included in a standard food parcel for most food banks here www.TheCamdenPoint.com, and it's worth keeping an eye on your local food bank's website and social media platforms for more information about what items they're particularly in need of. You can drop off items at the food bank itself or a local donation point; you'll find those details on their website too.
    For more information on volunteering, head to www.The CamdenPoint.com/volunteer-or-donate. </p>
  <p><b>Will food banks support schools and families who rely on free school meals now that schools have closed?</b></p>
  <p>We know that food banks often see an increase in the number of emergency parcels provided to children during the school holidays, when there is extra financial pressure on families who rely on free school meals. We're working to understand the impact of the government's recent announcements about school closures and what support the government is planning to provide to families on low incomes.
    We would advise families who are worried they don't have enough money for food to contact their local food bank to see how they can access support. Because each food bank in our network is an independent charity, it's difficult to say what support they will be able to offer schools as the picture will look different in different areas.
    Find your local food bank here www.TheCamdenPoint.com/find-a-foodbank and get in touch to understand their plans. Many of the food banks in our network are running reduced services with fewer volunteers, so it's likely they will struggle to deliver extra services like a lunch club, but they may be able to talk to you about how to ensure families can get emergency food parcels if needed.</p>
  <p><b>Can I donate?</b></p>
  <p>During this time of uncertainty, any donations would be much appreciated, particularly as food banks are likely to see an increase in the number of food parcels given out over the next few weeks. Food banks look after their own food donations, so if you want to donate get in touch with your local food bank by going to www.TheCamdenPoint.com/find-a-foodbank.</p>
  <p><b>I'm self-isolating and need a food parcel - what should I do?</b></p>
  <p>If you need a food parcel because you're unable to afford food, find your local food bank here www.trusselltrust.org/find-a-foodbank and get in touch with them to find out which referral agency you need to speak to or get hold of to get a voucher, as the food banks in our network work on a voucher referral system. If you're self-isolating, you'll need to talk to the food bank about whether or not they can deliver a food parcel or whether someone would need to collect it for you.
    If you can afford food or aren't in financial difficulty but can't get to the shops because you're self-isolating, you should contact your local council or Citizens Advice for support. Food banks can only help people who don't have enough money for food and many are having to run reduced services in order to do this safely during the outbreak, so they're not best placed to deliver to you.   </p>
  <p><b>I have a baby, can you help with supplies of nappies and baby food?</b></p>
  <p>The food banks in our network usually carry a small stock of nappies and baby foods, which they can add to your parcel. Please let the food bank know when you arrive if you need additional items for your baby. We will also signpost you to local provision for further support where possible.
  </p>
  <p><b>What if I can't get to the foodbank centre?</b></p>
  <p>Our foodbank may be able to deliver your food parcel to your home, especially if you have mobility needs or are unwell. Please discuss this with the food bank directly to discuss this as some are able to do this and some cannot.</p>
